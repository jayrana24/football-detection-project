##  Football detection project
* This model detects Players,Referees and Football in a video using YOLO.
* For better performance a roboflow dataset is used to further train the yolo model.
* K-Means is used for clustering and pixel segmentation to assign players teams.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python,
* **Computer Vision:** OpenCV (`cv2`)
* **AI Model:** Ultralytics YOLO (YOLOv5)
* **Data Handling:** NumPy, Pandas
